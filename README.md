Dear hackathon contributors, 

I have invited you to this repo because you haven't completed all mandatory prerequisities yet to become part of the [github organization](https://github.com/rh-ibm-synergy), so please follow all steps (mainly steps 2 and 3) as described in the guidance https://github.ibm.com/tomas-nykodym/redhat-ibm/blob/master/README.md

Without those steps you won't be able to access your repository nor to accept the invi.

Also update your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) with your Full Name and Company.

Thank you
Tomas Nykodym

If needed ping me via Slack.
